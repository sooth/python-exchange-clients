# WebSocket and Subscription Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Subscription Spam (FIXED)
**Problem**: MarketList component was subscribing to ALL 470+ tickers, exceeding the 250 channel limit
**Solution**: 
- Limited subscriptions to top 30 markets by volume
- Added separate subscription for selected symbol if not in top 30
- File: `frontend/components/markets/MarketList.tsx`

### 2. ExchangeOrder Attribute Error (FIXED)
**Problem**: Backend was accessing `clientOrderId` but the attribute is `clientId`
**Solution**:
- Fixed attribute access in `place_order` and `fetch_orders` methods
- Updated to use only available attributes from ExchangeOrder dataclass
- File: `backend/services/exchange_manager.py`

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. **MarketList.tsx**:
   - Added `topMarkets` calculation to get top 30 markets by volume
   - Limited WebSocket subscriptions to these top markets
   - Added conditional subscription for selected symbol
   - This prevents exceeding the 250 channel limit

### Backend Changes
1. **exchange_manager.py**:
   - Fixed `clientOrderId` â†’ `clientId` in OrderResponse mapping
   - Fixed `orderType` attribute access (was using `type`)
   - Set unavailable fields to None or default values
   - Fixed both `place_order` and `fetch_orders` methods

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start the trading platform**:
   ```bash
   ./start_trading_platform.sh
   ```

2. **Monitor logs for**:
   - No more "Subscription limit reached" spam
   - No more ExchangeOrder attribute errors
   - Successful order fetching

3. **Test functionality**:
   - Market list should show real-time updates for top 30 markets
   - Selecting a market should show real-time data
   - Order operations should work without errors

## Remaining Improvements (Optional)

1. **Pagination for market list** - Show more markets on demand
2. **Lazy loading** - Load additional markets as user scrolls
3. **Subscription cleanup** - Unsubscribe when components unmount
4. **Smart subscription strategy** - Subscribe to user's watchlist/favorites
5. **Backend subscription filtering** - Deduplicate at backend level

## Performance Impact

- Reduced WebSocket subscriptions from 470+ to ~31 max
- Eliminated subscription spam in logs
- Fixed order management functionality
- System should be more stable with less resource usage
