# Order Filter Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Changes - Tab Style ✓
- Changed from button filters to tab-style matching Balances/Open Orders/Order History
- Added three tabs: "All Orders", "Orders", "TP/SL"
- Styling matches exactly:
  - Active tab: `text-text-primary border-b-2 border-accent-primary`
  - Inactive tab: `text-text-secondary hover:text-text-primary`
  - Tab sizing: `px-4 py-2 text-xs font-medium`

### 2. TP/SL Detection Logic - Enhanced ✓
- Made detection more inclusive to catch AVAX-PERP as TP/SL
- Checks multiple criteria:
  - Order type contains: 'stop', 'tp', 'sl', 'take_profit'
  - Has stopPrice field
  - Has triggerPrice field
  - Has stopLoss field
  - Has takeProfit field
  - Has reduceOnly flag (often used for TP/SL)
- Added debug logging for AVAX-PERP orders

### 3. Visual Indicators
- TP/SL orders show with yellow badge
- Regular orders show with gray badge

## Testing

1. Check the browser console for AVAX-PERP debug output:
```javascript
AVAX-PERP order debug: {
  type: "limit",  // or whatever type
  isTPSL: true/false,
  reduceOnly: true/false,
  stopPrice: undefined/value,
  triggerPrice: undefined/value,
  allFields: {...}
}
```

2. The tabs should now look identical to Balances/Open Orders/Order History tabs

3. AVAX-PERP sell orders should now appear under TP/SL tab

## If AVAX-PERP Still Shows as Regular Order

Please check the console debug output and share:
1. The order type value
2. All fields present on the order
3. Any special fields that might indicate it's a TP/SL

This will help determine what specific criteria makes AVAX-PERP a TP/SL order.
