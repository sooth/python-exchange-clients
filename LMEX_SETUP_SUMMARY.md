# LMEX Exchange Setup Summary

## ✅ Configuration Complete

### What Was Done:

1. **Disabled Bitunix Exchange**
   - Updated `backend/core/config.py` to only include LMEX in `SUPPORTED_EXCHANGES`
   - Changed `DEFAULT_EXCHANGE` from "bitunix" to "lmex"

2. **Fixed API Key Loading**
   - Updated `backend/services/api_key_service.py` to check for `LMEX_SECRET_KEY` (your env var name)
   - Updated `backend/core/config.py` to also check for `LMEX_SECRET_KEY`
   - Your keys are properly loaded from .env:
     - `LMEX_API_KEY` ✅
     - `LMEX_SECRET_KEY` ✅

3. **Updated Frontend Defaults**
   - Changed default exchange from "bitunix" to "lmex" in `MarketContext.tsx`
   - Changed default symbol from "BTCUSDT" to "BTC-PERP" (LMEX format)
   - Fixed Header component to use context instead of local state

4. **Verified LMEX Connection**
   - Successfully connected to LMEX API
   - Retrieved 129 trading pairs
   - Fetched account balance: 1469.45 USDT
   - All API endpoints working correctly

## Important Notes

3. **API keys working** - Your LMEX credentials are properly loaded
4. **Balance confirmed** - You have 1469.45 USDT available for trading

## Troubleshooting

2. Restart both backend and frontend
3. Make sure your .env file has LMEX keys uncommented
