# Fix Lucide React Dependency - Plan

## Issue
The frontend is failing to compile because `lucide-react` is not installed, but it's being imported in the Header component.

## Root Cause
The Header component is trying to import the Menu icon from `lucide-react` package which is not listed in the package.json dependencies.

## Solution Steps

### Phase 1: Install Missing Dependency
- [x] ~~Install lucide-react package~~ (Decided to use inline SVG instead)
- [x] ~~Verify package.json is updated~~ (Not needed)
- [x] Check for any other missing dependencies

### Phase 2: Verify Icon Usage
- [x] Check all components for lucide-react imports
- [x] Ensure all used icons are available
- [x] Test that icons render correctly

### Phase 3: Alternative Solution (if needed)
- [x] Replace lucide-react icons with inline SVGs
- [x] Use existing icon solutions
- [x] Remove dependency on external icon library

### Phase 4: Test Application
- [x] Start frontend development server
- [x] Verify no compilation errors
- [x] Check that all icons display properly
- [x] Test responsive behavior

## Solution Implemented
Instead of adding the lucide-react dependency, I replaced the Menu icon import with an inline SVG. This approach:
1. Eliminates the external dependency
2. Reduces bundle size
3. Provides the same visual result
4. Avoids potential future dependency conflicts

The Menu icon in the Header component now uses a standard hamburger menu SVG icon.
